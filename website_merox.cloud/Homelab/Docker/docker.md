#  Docker

Docker offers advantages over virtual machines by being more resource-efficient and faster due to container technology, which shares the host's kernel. It ensures consistent environments across different stages, simplifying deployment and reducing compatibility issues. Docker's efficient resource use and deployment agility make it a cost-effective solution for application management compared to VMs.

## Install
+++ Docker install


Before you install Docker Engine for the first time on a new host machine, you need to set up the Docker repository. Afterward, you can install and update Docker from the repository.

1. Set up Docker's apt repository.

  ```bash #
  # Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
  ```
2. Install the Docker packages.
```bash #
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
!!!warning DISTRO
 If you use an Ubuntu derivative distro, such as Linux Mint, you may need to use UBUNTU_CODENAME instead of VERSION_CODENAME.
!!!

3. Verify that the Docker Engine installation is successful by running the hello-world image.
```bash #
sudo docker run hello-world
```

+++ Portainer install

1. First, create the volume that Portainer Server will use to store its database:
```bash #
docker volume create portainer_data
```
2. Then, download and install the Portainer Server container:
```bash #
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
```
!!!info
 By default, Portainer generates and uses a self-signed SSL certificate to secure port 9443

# Apps

- In the dynamic world of PulsarDC, Docker containers play a pivotal role in our virtual machine "alto", simplifying application deployment and management. To streamline these operations, we employ Portainer, an intuitive UI for Docker container management. Here's an overview of our active Docker containers and their functions:


+++ Monitoring
## Monitoring

 ### 🚨 **alertmanager**

Manages and forwards alerts generated by monitoring tools, ensuring timely notifications for system administrators.

### 📊 **cadvisor**

Provides analytics and performance metrics for running containers, aiding in resource optimization and monitoring.

### 📈 **grafana**

A powerful analytics and monitoring solution that visualizes time series data, perfect for observing system performance metrics.

### 🔍 **prometheus**

An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, and alerting functionality.

### 📡 **node-exporter**

Collects and exposes a wide range of hardware and OS metrics with Prometheus, crucial for system monitoring.
