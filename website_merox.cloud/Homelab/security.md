# CyberSecurity

- Welcome to the core of my digital fortress. With over two years of professional experience as a cybersecurity engineer and a profound journey in system administration focusing on Linux, networking, and security, I've honed my skills to craft a homelab that's not just a testbed for technology but a bulwark against digital threats.
{.grid-list}

#### Restricted Access:
   üîê **Access Control**: Leveraging biometric verification and secure device placement, ensuring that only I can navigate the sanctum of my technological domain.

   üåâ **Network Moats**: Configuring smart port guardians on my routers and switches to permit solely known allies (devices), repelling any unidentified invaders.
   #### Firewall rules:
   Here are some basic examples of my firewall rules from my homelab.
        Command:
```bash
iptables -A INPUT -d LAN_ADDRESS -p tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT #Anti Lockout rule

iptables -A FORWARD -d DESTINATION_IP -j ACCEPT #pfB_PRI1_v4 auto rule

iptables -A FORWARD -s OPT1_NET -d X.X.X.X -p tcp -j ACCEPT
```

#### üõ† Essential Service Management

   **Service Disablement**: Non-essential services across devices are disabled to minimize vulnerabilities.
        **Example**: Disabling unused services via **systemctl disable** <service_name> on Linux
        servers.
 > Always check your running services. ON ALL SYSTEMS, LINUX IS JUST AN EXAMPLE HERE
 {.is-warning}
```bash
  root@alto ~# systemctl list-units --type=service --state=active
  UNIT                                 LOAD   ACTIVE SUB     DESCRIPTION
  blk-availability.service             loaded active exited  Availability of block devices
  console-getty.service                loaded active running Console Getty
  container-getty@1.service            loaded active running Container Getty on /dev/tty1
  container-getty@2.service            loaded active running Container Getty on /dev/tty2
  containerd.service                   loaded active running containerd container runtime
  cron.service                         loaded active running Regular background program processing daemon
  dbus.service                         loaded active running D-Bus System Message Bus
  docker.service                       loaded active running Docker Application Container Engine
  fail2ban.service                     loaded active running Fail2Ban Service
```

#### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Security Assessment Tools

   **Nessus, Nmap, Wireshark**: Employed for deep network insights.
       Nmap Command:
 ```bash
     nmap -sV -O -p- 192.168.1.0/24 #for comprehensive network scanning.
 ```
   **Burp Suite**: Utilized for rigorous web application testing.
       Demo: Setting up Burp Suite as a proxy for HTTP/HTTPS traffic to inspect web application requests and responses.

#### üåç Internet Exposure and Protection

   **HTTPS Traffic**: Managed by Traefik, ensuring secure web exposure.
        Traefik Config: Enforce HTTPS using middleware redirections in Traefik.
    ![traefik2.png](/traefik2.png)


   **SSL/TLS**: Harnessing LetsEncrypt and Cloudflare for encrypted connections.
        Cloudflare Setting: Enabling "WAF" in the Cloudflare dashboard.
![cf.png](/cf.png)

#### üõ° Firewall and Intrusion Detection

   **pfBlockerNG & Snort**: Integral for intrusion detection.
        **Snort Rule**:
 ```bash
 alert icmp any any -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ICMP test"; sid:1000001;) #for ICMP traffic monitoring.
```
   **Monitoring with Grafana**: Visualizes security posture.
        Grafana Dashboard: Set up a dashboard to monitor real-time network traffic and alerts from Snort.
![fwgraf.png](/fwgraf.png)

#### üîë Password Management

   **Password Manager**: Essential for secure credential storage.
        **Best Practice**: Use of complex passwords and enabling two-factor authentication where possible.

#### üß™ Penetration Testing

   **Kali Linux Machine**: Dedicated for security testing and penetration exercises.
        **Metasploit Example**: msfconsole to launch Metasploit for vulnerability exploitation and testing.
 ```bash
   msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD <payload_name>
set LHOST <local_host>
exploit
```

### ZAP - Zed Attack Proxy

Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is a free, open-source penetration testing tool being maintained under the umbrella of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). ZAP is designed specifically for testing web applications and is both flexible and extensible.

At its core, ZAP is what is known as a ‚Äúman-in-the-middle proxy.‚Äù It stands between the tester‚Äôs browser and the web application so that it can intercept and inspect messages sent between browser and web application, modify the contents if needed, and then forward those packets on to the destination. It can be used as a stand-alone application, and as a daemon process.
